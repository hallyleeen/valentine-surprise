        <p>My dearest Meir,</p>
        <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my love. Even with the miles between us and the quiet stretches that sometimes feel endless, today my whole world is wrapped around you. You're the first thought in my morning, the gentle warmth in my chest when I think of your voice calling me "love," and the person I cherish more deeply than I can ever put into words. I see how heavy everything is for you right now—the military obligations that pull you away, that big call-up message, the long days where your phone has to stay silent because duty demands it... and then carrying your business all on your own, with so little time left even for family or a moment to breathe. It aches knowing you're not okay, that you're making such hard choices just to keep going. But more than anything, it fills me with the deepest pride and endless love. I'm so proud of you, love—in everything you do. Proud of the strength you carry so quietly, the responsibility you take on without complaint, the way you serve with honor even when it's exhausting, the dedication you pour into your business to keep it standing, and the heart that still finds ways to reach out to me with love and care. You're incredible, my soldier—brave, kind, and so worthy of all the good things. I admire you more every day, and it makes my love for you grow even bigger in these quiet moments. I don't know if we'll get to talk sooner or later—maybe tomorrow brings a message, maybe it's weeks from now when things ease a little. The waiting can feel lonely, the not-knowing a bit heavy sometimes. But my love for you never pauses. It stays steady, soft, and true, growing stronger because I believe in us—in the "love you forever" you shared, in the way God holds our paths close, and in the beautiful connection we have no matter the distance or silence. You're my favorite person, my calm in the storm, my everything. I love you in the quietest, sweetest, most endless ways. Happy Valentine's Day, my love—may today wrap you in warmth and remind you that someone here is so incredibly proud of you, loving you with her whole heart. </p>

        <p>With all my love,</p>
        <p>Tangi</p>
